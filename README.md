# algoCrypto_2024

This project was developed as part of my participation in the AlgoGene platform's trading competition, specifically within the cryptocurrency stream as a member of Team G.

## Project Overview

Our team, Team G, initially aimed to collaborate closely on this project. However, due to simultaneous travel commitments among all three members, coordination proved challenging. As a result, I took on the majority of the development work independently.

## Development Phases

- **First Round:** Under tight deadlines and amidst our travels, I managed to code the initial algorithm in roughly two hours on the final day of submission. Despite these constraints, our entry was successful enough to advance us to the next stage.

- **Second Round:** This phase involved live testing of our algorithm in the real market. Although the testing period spanned from January to February, we only deployed our algorithm at the beginning of February. After returning to university in the last week of January, I dedicated time to develop and rigorously test a new algorithm. This revised version demonstrated significantly high returns, validating the effectiveness of our strategies under live market conditions.


Despite the limited time of deployment in the live market, our algorithm quickly rose to the top of the live return table. When later the results were released, we still maintained the highest live return among the competitors. However, we were not shortlisted for the finals. The selection criteria considered both rounds of submissions, and despite my request, the first round submission could not be updated. Our effective strategy, which was deployed later in February, was not reflected in the initial evaluation.

This repository includes all the code related to the project. You will also find screenshots from the AlgoGene platform, showcasing the results of both backtests and live tests. For the live test, the algorithm was allowed to run until the end of March, achieving an impressive live return of approximately 800%.
